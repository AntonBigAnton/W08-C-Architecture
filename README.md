# CS2002 W08-C-Architecture

This is my implementation of the [W08-C-Architecture practical for CS2002](https://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/CS2002/Coursework/W08-C-Architecture/W08-C-Architecture.pdf).

## Source files

All source files are in the src folder. These are:
- 4 C program files,
- 2 header files,
- An x86-64 Assembly file,
- A Makefile.
  
My submission also contains a report and this README.md file

## Usage

To run the code, please use the Makefile and run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
make clean
make
./TryStackFrames
```
The output should be similar to the following image:

## Testing

To run the tests, please use the Makefile and run the following commands in the terminal:
